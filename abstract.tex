    \begin{abstract}
        For random walks on graph $\gr$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the mean hitting time $H_j$ from a vertex chosen from the stationary distribution to vertex $j$ measures the importance for $j$, while the Kemeny constant $K$ is the mean hitting time from one vertex to another selected randomly according to the stationary distribution. In this paper, we first establish a connection between the two quantities, representing $K$ in terms of $H_j$ for all vertices. We then develop an efficient algorithm estimating $H_j$ for all vertices and $K$ in nearly linear time of $m$. Moreover, we extend the centrality $H_j$ of a single vertex to $H(S)$ of a vertex set $S$, and establish a link between $H(S)$ and some other quantities. We further study the NP-hard problem of selecting a group $S$ of $k\ll n$ vertices with minimum $H(S)$, whose objective function is monotonic and supermodular. We finally propose two greedy algorithms approximately solving the problem. The former has an approximation factor $(1-\frac{k}{k-1}\frac{1}{e})$ and $O(kn^3)$ running time, while the latter returns a $(1-\frac{k}{k-1}\frac{1}{e}-\epsilon)$-approximation solution in nearly-linear time of $m$, for any parameter $0<\epsilon <1$. Extensive experiment results validate the performance of our algorithms.
